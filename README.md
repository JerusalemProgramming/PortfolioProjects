I was tasked to create a custom Inventory-Client Database program that needed to manage inventory of local antiquities dealer here in Jerusalem, as well as to track sales of each item to specific client if/when an item was sold.  Dealer wanted the inventory database to calculate total cost and profit of the entire inventory which meant that each item's cost and profit had to be calculated first individually.  Additionally the dealer wanted this custom Inventory-Client Database to automatically generate invoices for each sale of item(s) to each client so that these automatically-generated invoice files could be delivered to Accountant-Tax-Attorney as either BULK PDF/DOC FILES and/or BULK PRINTED INVOICES for tax returns at the end of each fiscal business year's cost/profit calculations.

Because "Content is King" for Big Data Science Programming, the most critical and basic first step was to design & architect the database around some logic of organization of the data.  We needed to track Items of antiquities, and each Item could only be sold to one Client.
